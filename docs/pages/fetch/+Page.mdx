import { ConfigWhereClient } from '../../components'

**Environment**: client.

You can specify the fetch function that Telefunc uses for making HTTP requests on the client side.

This is useful for customizing the request and response behavior.

```js
// Environment: client

import { config } from 'telefunc/client'
import { customFetch } from '../path/to/custom-fetch'

config.fetch = customFetch
```

<ConfigWhereClient />
