import { ConfigWhereClient } from '../../components'

**Environment**: client.

You can specify the fetch function that Telefunc uses for HTTP requests on the client side.

This is useful for customizing the request and response behavior, or for using httpHeaders under more dynamic conditions.

```js
// Environment: client

import { config } from 'telefunc/client'
import { customFetch } from '../path/to/custom-fetch'

config.fetch = customFetch 
```

<ConfigWhereClient />
