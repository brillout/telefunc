Using Telefunc to upload files is currently only supported by encoding the files as a strings, for example as [Data URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs). You can use [`FileReader.readAsDataURL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL) to encode to a `File` object to a Data URL. However, be aware that files encoded in this way are at least [33% larger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64#encoded_size_increase).

Another possibility is to use an endpoint separate from Telefunc to handle file uploads. For example, you can use [expressjs/multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) when using Node.js.
