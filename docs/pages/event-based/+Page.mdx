With REST or GraphQL, API endpoints are:

- Generic (agnostic to your frontend)
- Backend-owned (defined and implemented by the backend team)

With Telefunc, it's usually the opposite — telefunctions are typically:

- Tailored (bespoke to your frontend)
- Frontend-owned (defined and implemented by the frontend team)

This inversion leads to a significantly faster development speed.

You may be tempted to create generic telefunctions out of habit from REST or GraphQL, but this is usually an anti-pattern. Instead, we recommend implementing what we call *event-based* telefunctions.

In the example below, we explain why it leads to better <Link href="/RPC#rpc-security">RPC security</Link> and increased <Link href="/RPC#rpc-speed">RPC speed</Link>.




## Example

Imagine an existing to-do list app, and the product manager requests a new feature: add a new button `Mark all tasks as completed`.

With a RESTful API, the app would typically do this:

```shell
HTTP            URL                                           PAYLOAD
=========       =========================================     =====================
# Make a request to fetch all non-completed tasks
GET             https://api.todo.com/task?completed=false     ∅
# Make a request per task to update it
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/42                  { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/1337                { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/7                   { "completed": true }
```

> With REST, it's usually the backend team that is responsible for defining and implementing the API.

This is inefficient as it makes a lot of HTTP requests (the infamous `N+1` problem).

With Telefunc, you can do this instead:

```ts
// components/TodoList.telefunc.ts
// Environment: server

import { Tasks } from '../database/Tasks'

export async function onMarkAllAsCompleted() {
  // With an ORM:
  await Tasks.update({ completed: true }).where({ completed: false })

  // Or with SQL:
  await sql('UPDATE tasks SET completed = true WHERE completed = false')
}
```

> With Telefunc, it's usually the frontend team that is responsible for defining and implementing telefunctions.

> The telefunction `onMarkAllAsCompleted()` is tailored: it's created specifically to serve the needs of the `<TodoList>` component, whereas a RESTful API is generic (it's a set of endpoints that are agnostic to your frontend).

We recommend naming telefunctions `onSomeEvent()` (see <Link href="#naming-convention"/>), since a telefunction call is always triggered by some kind of event — typically a user action such as the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)'s [click event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) (e.g. the user clicks on a button) or [load event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) (e.g. the user opens the page).

```shell
# Co-locating the component's telefunctions
components/TodoList.telefunc.ts
components/TodoList.tsx
```

```tsx
// components/TodoList.tsx
// Environment: client

import { onMarkAllAsCompleted } from './TodoList.telefunc.ts'

function TodoList() {
  return <>
    {/* ... */}
    <button onClick={onMarkAllAsCompleted}>
      Mark all as completed
    </button>
  </>
}
```

> With Telefunc, you think in terms of what the frontend needs, instead of thinking in terms of the backend publicly exposing data.
>
> From that perspective, it's a lot more natural to co-locate telefunctions next to UI components, rather than next to where data comes from.

You might find the naming convention annoyingly restrictive, but it offers important advantages — which we now explain.

To keep things [DRY](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/400183/what-should-i-consider-when-the-dry-and-kiss-principles-are-incompatible) you may be tempted to define a single telefunction that is re-used by many UI components, for example:

```ts
// database/actions/tasks.telefunc.ts
// Environment: server

import { Task } from '../models/Task'
import { getContext } from 'telefunc'

// One telefunction used by multiple UI components
export async function udpateTask(id: number, mods: Partial<typeof Task>) {
  const { user } = getContext()
  const task = await Task.update(mods).where({ id, author: user.id })
  // Returns the updated value task.modifiedAt
  return task
}
```

But this has issues:
- It makes reasoning about <Link href="/RPC#rpc-security">RPC security</Link> harder, leading to subtle bugs and security issues.
  > As explained at <Link href="/RPC" />, telefunctions are public: the user can call `updateTask({ author: Math.floor(Math.random()*100000) })` which is obviously an issue.
  >
  > A cornerstone of security is giving only the permissions that are strictly required.
- It decreases <Link href="/RPC#rpc-speed">RPC speed</Link>.
  > Because `updateTask()` is generic, it must `return task` in case a component requires `task.modifiedAt` — but if some components don't need it, this results in wasted network bandwidth.

We recommend the following instead:

```js
// database/actions/task.ts

import { getContext } from 'telefunc'

// This isn't a telefunction: it's a normal server-side function
export async function udpateTask(id: number, mods: Partial<Task>) {
  const { user } = getContext() // Can also be used in normal functions
  const task = await Task.update(mods).where({ id, author: user.id })
  // Returns the updated value task.modifiedAt
  return task
}
```

```js
// components/TodoList.telefunc.ts

import { updateTask } from '../database/actions/task'

// Returns task.modifiedAt
export const onTodoTextUpdate = (id: number, text: string) => updateTask(id, { text })
// Doesn't return task.modifiedAt
export const onTodoCompleted = (id: number) => { await updateTask(id, { completed: false }) }
```

It's slightly less DRY but, in exchange, you get an improved structure around security and speed.

> If there are two UI components that could use the exact same telefunction — wouldn't it be nice to create a single telefunction instead of two?
> - It's a rare situation (UI components usually have slightly different requirements).
> - Consider creating a new shared UI component used by these two UI components.
> - Using the deduplication approach show above, only one line of duplicated code remains:
>   ```js
>   // TodoItem.telefunc.js
>   // Defined once for <TodoItem>
>   export const onTodoTextUpdate = (id: number, text: string) => updateTask(id, { text })
>   ```
>   ```js
>   // TodoList.telefunc.js
>   // Defined again for <TodoList> — the code duplication is only one line of code
>   export const onTodoTextUpdate = (id: number, text: string) => updateTask(id, { text })
>   ```

All in all, event-based telefunctions and the naming convention lead to a more effective use of Telefunc.


## Naming convention

For a crystal-clear structure and more effective use of Telefunc, we recommend naming telefunctions `onSomeEvent()`.

```bash
    TELEFUNCTIONS
    =============
❌  updateTodo() # generic telefunction
✅  onTodoTextUpdate() # tailored telefunction
✅  onTodoComplete() # tailored telefunction

❌  loadData()
✅  onLoad()
✅  onPagination()
✅  onInfiniteScroll()
```

We also recommend co-locating `.telefunc.js` files next to your UI component files.

```shell
    FILES
    =====
    components/TodoItem.tsx
✅  components/TodoItem.telefunc.ts
❌  db/todo.telefunc.ts

    components/User.vue
✅  components/User.telefunc.js
❌  db/user/getLoggedInUser.telefunc.js
```

Telefunc shows a warning when the naming convention isn't followed — you can remove the warning with <Link text={<code>config.disableNamingConvention</code>} href="/disableNamingConvention" />.

> Not following the naming convention is perfectly fine, though we recommend having a clear reason for breaking the rule.
>
> We recommend carefully reading the <Link href="#example">example above</Link> before opting out of the convention. It explains why event-based telefunctions lead to:
> - Better <Link href="/RPC#rpc-security">RPC security</Link>
> - Increased <Link href="/RPC#rpc-speed">RPC speed</Link>

## Exception: several clients

If your telefunctions are used by multiple clients, it can make sense to define a few generic telefunctions that cover all clients, instead of creating different telefunctions for each client.

> Alternatively, you can deploy one Telefunc server per client to preserve the fast development speed of tailored telefunctions.
