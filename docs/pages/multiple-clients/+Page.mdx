If your telefunctions are used by multiple clients, we recommend deploying one Telefunc server per client, in order to preserve all the <Link href="/event-based">benefits of event-based telefunctions</Link>. In other words, each client uses a different set of event-based telefunctions.

That said, if the client needs are similar, it case make sense to <Link href="/event-based#opt-out">opt-out of event-based telefunctions</Link> and create telefunctions that are slight more generic.
