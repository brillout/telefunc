// All possible JavaScript file extensions as Glob Pattern.
//  - Needs to work with Micromatch: https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch because:
//    - Vite's `import.meta.glob()` uses Micromatch
//  - We need this to be a whitelist because:
//   - A pattern `*([a-zA-Z0-9]` doesn't work.
//     - Because of ReScript: `.res` are ReScript source files which need to be ignored. (The ReScript compiler generates `.js` files alongside `.res` files.)
//   - Black listing doesn't work.
//     - We cannot implement a blacklist with a glob pattern.
//     - A post `import.meta.glob()` blacklist filtering doesn't work because Vite would still process the files (e.g. including them in the bundle).
